    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In this activity, we were given a package with a bunch of logic gates and a description of how each of them worked. We then had to write all posible states of the circuits provided. At the end, we made our own circuits and had to make a list of all posible outcomes of that circuit
    </blockquote>
    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        It was a bit interesting but it was boring having to predict all of the outcomes for each state of each circuit.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I didn't really learn anything since I all ready knew how each of them worked because I like to make complex electrical circuits in Rust.
