    <!--Explain the work/assignment Did you enjoy the work? What did you learn?-->
    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In the electronic research assignment, we were given a list of electrical components and we needed to give a breif description of what it does and an example of where it can be used. 
    </blockquote>
    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I didn't really enjoy this one because it was a really repedative task, we had to google each component and find an article with a description and/or a example of how its used.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I don't think I learned much from this assignment since I just tried to do it as fast as posible and didn't really pay much attention to what each of them did.
