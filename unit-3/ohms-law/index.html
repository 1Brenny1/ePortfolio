    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        The Ohm's law activity wasn't great, we just watched a slide show on how they were supposed to be used and then we were given a package where we had to do some math calculations to predict the amount of voltage, current or resistance.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        It was pretty boring because it was like the logic gates, just a slide show then a small package that we had to go through and do some math calculations.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I feel like I didn't really learn much since I all ready knew a bit of what they were for and why we needed them before hand.
