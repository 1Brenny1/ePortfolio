    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In the cybersecurity assignment, we were tasked to complete the intro to cybersecurity course by <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en_ca/index.html">Cisco</a>.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        This assignment I didn't find as much fun as the others because all we were doing were reading a large article and answering some simple questions from the article.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I don't think I learned much from it because I all ready knew a bit about that topic. But it was interesting to do.
