    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In the Arduino assignment, we were given a digital resource with tutorials on how to complete certain tasks using an arduino. Once we did all of the tutorials and we had some what of an understanding, we were tasked with making a car gate, vault door, and a trafic light system.

    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I really enjoyed this activity because this was one of the only things that we did in this class where we whould acually program stuff. It was also fun figuring out how to set it up and it was exciting when I finnaly got it working.

    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In this activity, I learned the basic syntax and the basics of programming in the arduino programming language. I also learned how to wire components up to make them work properly.
