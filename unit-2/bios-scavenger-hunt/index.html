    <!--Explain the work/assignment Did you enjoy the work? What did you learn?-->
    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In the BIOS scavenger hunt assignment, we looked around a bios simulator looking for sertain settings and copying the values from that setting to a dock with the question of what the value is of that setting.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        The BIOS scavenger hunt assignment wasn't very fun for me, it just took a long time to do and wasn't very entertaining. It was cool to see what a BIOS looked like but there was nothing else that I enjoyed.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I feel like I didn't learn much from the BIOS scavenger hunt assignment, the only thing that I might take away from this assignment is where I found all of the answers.
