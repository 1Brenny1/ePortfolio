    <!--Explain the work/assignment Did you enjoy the work? What did you learn?-->
    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In the Malware Reseach Assignment, we each picked two pieces of malware off of a list and did research and made a presentation on the malware.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I all ready knew a bit about the malware that I was doing the project on but it was interesting to learn more about it and it was fun watching vidoes on how it worked.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I all ready knew a bit on my first topic WannaCry but I didn't know anything about MyDoom so I learned how it worked and attacked devices.
