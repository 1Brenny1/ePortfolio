    <!--Explain the work/assignment Did you enjoy the work? What did you learn?-->
    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In the Security system assignment, we were tasked with making a security system to keep our teachers lunch safe. We had to use an arduino and a bunch of different components to make it have a way to be activated and deactivate, make sounds and have blinking lights.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        This activity was acually really fun because we got to do programming along with a bit of electronics to make each of the components work.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I don't feel like I really learned anything from this assignment since it was just like all of the other arduino based assignments where we just added components and made a simple script to control them. However I did learn something on my own through this assignment. In my project, I learned and used multithreading to make each component on a different thread so I can make them blink or do a certain task independant from the rest.
