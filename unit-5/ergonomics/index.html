    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In the ergonomics assignment, we were tasked with picking 2 types of ergonmics and presenting our research on it. I did my presentation on Keyboards and DVORAK Keyboards.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        This acivity was kinda like all of the other research assignments, it didn't take long to make the presentation because I just had to write a small summary and some pros and cons of each and it was easy, but kinda nice to do.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        What I learned in this assignment was what a DVORAK keyboard was and how it looked. I also learned about some other types of keyboards which were interesting but also strange.
