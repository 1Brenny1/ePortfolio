    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In this assignment, we had to pick one important person off a list. I did mine on Ben Silbermann. We had to make a presentation and write about what that person did that was so great.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        This assignment was just another presentation where I didn't really have much fun doing but it was entertaining to read about this guys life story.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I feel like I didn't really learn much about Ben Silbermann but I did learn that he made Pinterest.
