    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In the Vex robot competitions assignment, we were split up into random teams and were each given a week to code our robot to make it acomplish a specific task. For example, my group had to grab a ball and put it in a cup and then after the automated part we would manually drive it and try and get as many as posible in the cup.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        This activity was really fun because like before, I got to meet and talk to some new people. However, I wasn't a big fan of the block coding that we needed to use.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        Like the other robot activity, I feel like I didn't really learn anything because it was just messing around and figuring out how to make it move in the correct direction to get the ball and move back to the cup.
