    <!--Explain the work/assignment Did you enjoy the work? What did you learn?-->
    <h3>What did we do?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        In the Carl robot activity, we were put into groups and each group was given a robot which we had to program to acomplish a few simple tasks.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>How did I enjoy it?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        This activity was really fun because we acually got to do a bit of programming which I really like doing. We were put into pre assigned groups so it was nice to talk to some new people. The one problem I had with the assignment was that you would get back the next day after working on it and everything would be messed up and it wouldn't be able to drive strait anymore.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I don't think we learned anything by doing this activity since we just coded the robot to move in a certain way. We were also using the arduino language meaning I didn't really have to learn anything to acually make it move.
